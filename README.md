# iiiEsotericLanguage

I made this python esoteric language interpreter for my esoteric language : iii which have the particularity to have his programms only composed by the character i.

This interpreter use a BrainFuck python interpreter and the synthax of iii and BrainFuck are in bijection, so whatewer can do BrainFuck, iii cans also do.

Also to note : BrainFuck is turing complete, so iii is. That means, with an infinite amount of ressources, any computable programe can be written in iii.

PS : Maybe the programms files of iii are a little bit heavy ^^ (A programm which print "Hello World!" is written with a file that contains 11394260736961616017478696325142642241587016089942641935756584435039981423330228839638374655156139739 i), but i implemented that a way you can play with the number of i and not necessarly the file itself.
